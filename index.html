    I'm Tucker Wray I write full stack Javascript. Giving back is important to me. I enjoy busting my knuckles under my jeep as much as I do squashing bugs in my terminal. I enjoy stuff thats not easy like that. Anything that puzzles me and encourages ingenuity is going to keep my attention." />

      <div class="introduction">
        <p>
          I currently nourish my growth mindset and apply my love of D-I-Y at
          Lambda School Academy of Web Development, Data Sciences and Software
          Engineering where I am employed remotely as a full-time Teacher's
          Assistant/ProjectLead. After work each day I login to LambdaSchool
          as a part-time student in the final unit of the 18 month Full-Stack
          Web track. I spend a fair amount of time working on code reviews,
          leading stand ups, and really get a kick out of squashing bugs pair
          programming style.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, I enjoy employing the latest advancements in
          software to help iterate on solutions to realworld problems for
          D-I-Y-ers like myself. Some current aspirations of mine involve web
          applications that help source local goods such as produce and
          services, reveal options for producing renewable energy at a small
          scale, provide suggestions for recycling plastic bottles at home
          based on your geolocation.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the rare occasion that I am not in a zoom call, terminal, or
          slack chat; chances are you'll find me wrestling my dog or cats,
          turning a wrench under my jeep or just cooling it by a creek in the
          forest.
